# Ethics Boundaries (KindPath / KindEarth)

This platform exists to return time, agency, and coherence.
It must not become an extraction engine.

## Non-negotiable Ethical Commitments

1. **No surveillance posture**
   - We do not build tools to monitor, police, or control people.

2. **No “scoring humans”**
   - Metrics are field indicators, not moral judgements.
   - The platform must not produce punitive rankings.

3. **No black-box decisioning**
   - Outputs must be interpretable by humans.
   - If it can’t be explained plainly, it can’t be used.

4. **No coercive integration**
   - The platform must not become a requirement for access to essential services.

5. **No data extraction**
   - Third-party monetisation of participant/community data is prohibited.

## High-Risk Areas (Require Extra Governance)

These areas can be useful, but can also be weaponised:

- predictive modelling in social systems
- cross-agency data linkage
- institutional performance comparisons
- economic posture models used to justify harm
- “nudge” systems that manipulate behaviour covertly

If any of these are pursued:
- they require explicit review
- they require documented safeguards
- they require refusal pathways
- they require local interpretive authority

## Boundaries for Economic Forecasting (In-house pilot only)

The KindPath Economic Forecasting Tool is:
- situational intelligence for internal learning
- posture mapping, not public signals
- not financial advice

It must not be used to:
- encourage gambling behaviour
- sell market predictions
- manipulate communities
- justify extractive investment logic

---

## Indigenous Sovereignty & Cultural Respect

Where Indigenous perspectives or knowledge systems are referenced:
- knowledge is treated as living and custodial
- extraction is prohibited
- refusal is valid
- governance must be appropriate to place and people

Nothing in this platform grants permission to generalise or instrumentalise Indigenous knowledge outside consent.

## Accountability & Review

Ethical drift is expected unless actively prevented.

Recommended mechanisms:
- change logs for governance decisions
- periodic internal ethics review (quarterly)
- a “stop-ship” rule for violations
- transparent documentation of failures and limitations

---

## Success Criteria

Ethics boundaries are working when:
- pilots end with greater autonomy, not dependency
- communities retain ownership and interpretive control
- outputs remain human-legible and non-punitive
- trust grows over time instead of collapsing
